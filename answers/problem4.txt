What is wrong with Ball.java? Please fix the problems with Ball.java and document
your work in problem4.txt. 

There were a few things wrong in Ball.java. The first issue was in the constructor. 
In the constructor color was set to color and volume was set to volume. This is incorrect. 
We needed to say this.color and this.volume to refer to the class variable of Ball.
