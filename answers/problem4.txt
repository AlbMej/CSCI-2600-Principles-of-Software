There were a few things wrong in Ball.java. The first issue was in the constructor. 
In the constructor color was set to color and volume was set to volume. This is incorrect. 
We needed to say this.color and this.volume to refer to the Ball's class variable of color and volume.
Another thing were the actual methods getVolume() and getColor(). getVolume() was returning zero when 
it should've returned the value of our class variable volume, which is obtained using this.volume.
getColor() was returning null when it should've returned the value of our class variable color, 
which is obtained using this.color.

There are two obvious approaches to implementing getVolume():
• Every time getVolume() is called, go through all the Balls in the Set and add
up the volumes. (Hint: one solution might be to use a for-each loop to extract
Balls from the Set.)
• Keep track of the total volume of the Balls in BallContainer whenever Balls
are added and removed. This eliminates the need to perform any computations
when getVolume() is called.
Which approach do you think is the better one? Why?
